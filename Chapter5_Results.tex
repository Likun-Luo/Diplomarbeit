\section{Comparison of simulation and measurement results}

\end{figure}

In fig. \ref{fig:third_octave_over_height}, the A-weighted sound pressure levels at measurement position a (10 cm away from vehicle) along the car body height in example one-third octave bands are shown. At each microphone position, the simulation result is compared with the measurement value. One can see that for 125 Hz and 400 Hz, the simulation fits the measured curves very well. Greater difference between the simulation and the measurement occurs for 1250 Hz and 2000 Hz, but the measured shape is still well approximated for both frequency bands. Other bands show similar results and the measured sound pressure level trends are captured well by the model.

\end{figure}

The overall sound pressure level is a simple and direct parameter to quantify the sound level. For comparison, the A-weighted sound pressure levels of each one-third octave band from 100 Hz to 2000 Hz are added up. Fig. \ref{fig:overall_SPL} shows the overall A-weighted sound pressure level at three different measurement positions and the deviation between the simulated and measured results. As can be seen from the results, the predictions of overall sound pressure levels at the three distances from car body agree well with the measurement. For all three measurement positions, the maximum deviation between the simulation and measurement results occurs at 0.5 m, which is at the height of the bogie. At these locations, the simulation results are overestimated by 1.5 dB to 3 dB. In general, the approximation is getting better with increasing height. For area above 2m, the difference between the simulation and the measurement in terms of overall sound pressure is within 1 dB.

	\caption{1/3-octave spectra of the A-weighted SPL for simulation and measurement data at selected microphone positions}
	\label{fig:freq_spectrum}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:freq_spectrum} shows the spectra of the A-weighted sound pressure level in one third octave bands. The SPL spectra are evaluated at the measurement position a (10 cm away from vehicle) at different microphone locations. As can be seen from the results, the simulation fits the measured spectra well, the measured trend is well captured. Again, larger deviation between the simulated and measured results occurs at 0.5 m above ground and the approximation is getting better with increasing height.

In order to have an idea of the model accuracy of each 1/3-octave band, the mean relative error between the simulation result and the measurement for each 1/3-octave band over all 27 microphone positions will be computed. To compute the mean relative error, the sound pressure level is first converted back to linear scaling

\begin{equation}
	p(\text{Pa}) = p_0 \cdot 10^{\frac{\text{SPL}}{20}} = 2\cdot10^{-5}\,\text{Pa} \cdot 10^{\frac{\text{SPL}}{20}}\text{.}
\end{equation}

The mean relative error (MRE) is then defined as

\begin{equation}
	\text{MRE}(p_{\text{measured}}, p_{\text{simulation}}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N - 1} \frac{|p_{\text{simulation,}i} - p_{\text{measured,}i}|}{|p_{\text{measured,}i}|}
\end{equation}

The mean relative error can also be converted to decibel using the relation

\begin{equation}
	\text{MRE(dB)} = 20\cdot\log_{10}(1 + \text{MRE})\text{.}
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

\begin{table}[H]
	\caption{Mean relative error of 1/3-octave frequency spectrum over all microphone positions}
	\begin{tabular}{c|cccccccccccccc}
		Freq (Hz)           & 100  & 125  & 160  & 200  & 250  & 315  & 400  & 500  & 630  & 800  & 1000 & 1250 & 1600 & 2000 \\ \hline
		MRE (dB) & 2.34 & 0.55 & 3.06 & 3.51 & 1.34 & 1.82 & 1.06 & 1.67 & 1.53 & 1.97 & 3.36 & 2.15 & 2.45 & 2.65
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:MRE_spectra}
\end{table}

The mean relative error in terms of the sound pressure levels over all 27 microphone positions at each frequency band between the predictions and the measurements are shown in fig. \ref{fig:gap_freq_spectrum} and in tab. \ref{tab:MRE_spectra}. As can be seen from the results, the best approximation occurs for 125 Hz band which has the smallest mean relative error among all 1/3 octave bands. Three frequency bands (160, 200 and 1000 Hz) have an error over 3 dB, and the maximum error is limited by 3.5 dB. Good approximation has also been shown for the frequency band from 250 to 800 Hz, for which the mean relative errors are within 2 dB. The average gap per frequency band is obtained by averaging the mean relative error spectrum over all 14 one-third octave bands. Following the same idea, the mean relative error in terms of overall sound pressure levels will also be used as a metric for model accuracy.

The average gap per frequency band and the mean relative error of overall sound pressure levels over all microphone positions are shown in tab. \ref{tab:average_gap}.


\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\caption{Average gap per frequency band and mean relative error of overall SPL of initial model}
	\begin{tabular}{c|c}
		Average gap per  frequency band (dB) & Mean relative error of overall SPL (dB) \\ \hline
		$2.14\pm1$                               & $0.73\pm0.86$                             
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:average_gap}
\end{table}

The average difference per frequency band is 2.14 dB and the mean relative error of overall sound pressure level is 0.73 dB. From these results it can be concluded that the finite element model is able to predict the sound transmission from the train underfloor adequately.


\section{Effect of geometric variation}

In this section, the results obtained by the variation analysis of underfloor geometry are shown. The geometrical models are illustrated and explained in section \ref{section:variation_geometry}.

	\label{fig:third_octave_over_height_geometry_variation}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:third_octave_over_height_geometry_variation} shows the A-weighted sound pressure level at measurement position a (10 cm away from vehicle) for different geometry variations in example one third octave bands. As can be seen from the results, at the lowest frequency band (100 Hz), there is almost no difference between the different models. This may due to the much larger wavelength (about 3.43 meter for 100 Hz) than the physical dimension of the geometry. At this frequency, all four models overestimates the sound pressure level by about 3 dB but are still able to capture the measured curve shape well. Large deviation between the models is found at 250 Hz, where the model without underfloor components shows an huge underestimation of the result and the model with additional structures tends to overestimate while the initial model and the model without air suspension are showing very good agreement with the measurement data. For 500 Hz and 1000 Hz, the model with additional structures and the model without air suspension are closest to the measurement data, respectively. In general, all models show similar shape as the measurement curves, the differences in terms of sound pressure level between the four models are within 10 dB. The same results are also observed for other frequency bands.

\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:overall_SPL_geometry} shows the distribution of  A-weighted overall sound pressure level at different distances from car body for different geometrical models. The difference between the simulation and the measurement results are plotted in the figures right. As can be seen from the figures, all four models show similar results in the lower area (up to 2 m height), deviation between the models starts to grow with increasing height. Comparing the initial model and the model without air suspension, the model without air suspension shows greater overestimation of the overall SPL than the initial model, at the height of bogie (0.5 m). Up from 1.5 m height, both models show very good agreement with the measurement results and there is almost no difference between both models. One can also see, without including any underfloor components into the model, the overall SPL is overestimated at each measurement location due to a lack of attenuation of the acoustic wave by the underfloor components. The difference between the initial model and the model without underfloor components is about 1 to 1.5 dB depending on the measurement locations. The model with additional underfloor structures shows a similar result as the initial model at 0.5 m height, but in the higher region (up from 1.5 m), the result converges to that of the model without underfloor components.

\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:gap_freq_spectrum_geometry} shows the mean relative error spectra for the four geometrical models over all 27 microphone locations, the spectrum of the initial model has also been shown in fig. \ref{fig:gap_freq_spectrum}. As can be seen from the figure, all three geometry variations show greater maximum error than the initial model. For a large part of the frequency bands, the model without underfloor components has the greatest deviation among the models. At frequency band 100, 315, 400, 630 and 2000 Hz, the difference in terms of the mean relative error among the models is small and limited by 1 dB. The initial model and the model without air suspension share similar results, but at frequency band 800, 1000, 1600 and 2000 Hz, the latter model shows better approximation than the former.

	\label{tab:geometry_variation_MRE}
	\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
		Geometry name              & Average gap per frequency band (dB) & MRE overall SPL (dB) \\ \hline
		No underfloor components   & $3.12\pm1.74$                       & $1.78\pm0.91$        \\
		No air suspension          & $2.21\pm1.27$                       & $0.85\pm1.05$        \\
		Initial model              & $2.34\pm1.00$                       & $0.73\pm0.86$        \\
		With additional structures & $2.57\pm1.38$                       & $1.30\pm0.76$       
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In order to quantify the difference between the geometry variations, the average gap per frequency band and the mean relative error in terms of overall SPL are computed and shown in tab. \ref{tab:geometry_variation_MRE}. The table is ordered by the complexity of the modeled geometry. As can be seen from results, the simplest model, namely the model without any underfloor components, shows the greatest average gap per frequency band as well as the largest mean relative error in terms of the overall sound pressure level. Both errors are reduced by almost 1 dB by including the most essential underfloor components (bogie and wheel) into the model. Taking the air suspension into account leads to a better approximation for the overall SPL, but a slightly increased average gap per frequency band, which may due to the sound hard assumption of the air suspension surface. Surprisingly, the model with additional structures shows a greater deviation in both metrics  compared to the initial model. It was expected that including more underfloor details will also lead to a better approximation of the measurement. It can be concluded from the results shown in this section that the number of modeled underfloor components do affect the prediction accuracy of the finite element model. To achieve better approximation of the measurement data, at least the bogie and the wheel should be taken into the geometrical model. Without modeling the underfloor components, the overall SPL is overestimated by about 1 dB compared to the model with underfloor components.
